# Copyright 2024 Moulberry

## Definitions

The **licensor** is the individual or entity offering these terms, and the **software** is the software the licensor makes available under these terms.

**You** refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these terms.

**Use** means anything you do with the software requiring one of your licenses.

## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses.

## Do Not Distribute

You may not reupload or redistribute the software, in whole or in part, modified or unmodified, alongside other software or standalone. This includes redistribution by creating or using software to automatically compile and/or download the software. In order to receive any license under these terms, you must obtain the software from the licensor or from a party authorized by the licensor.

## Do Not Compete

*For sake of clarity, this clause only applies if you are using the software to create a competing product. Simply using the software does not prevent you from creating similar works in the future, provided that the similar work does not contain parts of the software.*

You may not provide any software or product that:
1. Competes with the software
2. Competes with any product the licensor or any of its affiliates provides using the software

Goods and services compete even when they provide functionality through different kinds of interfaces or for different technical platforms. Applications can compete with services, libraries with plugins, frameworks with development tools, and so on, even if they’re written in different programming languages or for different computer architectures. Goods and services compete even when provided free of charge. If you market a product as a practical substitute for the software or another product, it definitely competes.

## Notice

The copyright notice (the first line of this license, starting with Copyright) and these terms must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

## Grant of Rights

The licensor grants you a free of charge, limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license for the software to do everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it for any permitted purpose, other than distributing the software, making changes/new works based on the software or competing with the software/the licensor.

## No Liability

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
